title: Raw API calls with curl_session
description: Mint a short-lived proxy token that forwards arbitrary HTTP requests to a provider's API with your credential injected.
---

The tool catalog is wide but not complete. GitHub alone has hundreds of endpoints, and the
plugin wraps 28 of them. When the endpoint you need has no tool, `curl_session` is the
escape hatch. It mints a 15-minute token that lets you send **any** HTTP request to that
provider's API through the workbench, with your real credential attached server-side.

You never see the credential. The proxy injects it.

## When to reach for it

| Situation | Use |
|---|---|
| A tool exists for the operation | [`execute_tools`](executing-tools.md) — validated args, slim responses, audit trail per tool |
| No tool wraps the endpoint | `curl_session` |
| You want a permanent capability | Write a plugin tool instead |

Prefer a tool where one exists. Tool calls get argument validation, per-tool audit
entries, and per-tool metrics. A proxied request gets an HTTP request log and nothing
tool-shaped.

## Minting a session

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{
  "name": "curl_session",
  "arguments": { "integrations": ["github"] }
}}
```

```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9…",
  "expiresIn": 900,
  "proxyBaseUrl": "https://workbench.example.com/c",
  "usage": "Send requests to https://workbench.example.com/c/<integration>/<path> with Authorization: Bearer <token>"
}
```

`integrations` is required and must have at least one entry. Multiple integrations in
one session are allowed, and the token then covers all of them.

Validation is **all-or-nothing**. Every requested name is checked, the failures are
collected, and if there is even one the call returns an error and mints nothing:

```json
{ "error": "gitlab: not connected; httpbin-cookie: curl proxy not enabled" }
```

The three per-name reasons are `integration not found`, `curl proxy not enabled`, and
`not connected`.

### The token

- A JWT with audience `workbench-curl`, carrying the user id and the list of allowed
  integrations.
- TTL is **900 seconds**, fixed at mint. It is not configurable, and there is no refresh
  or revoke — you mint a new one.
- It is *only* accepted at `/c/:integration/*`. It does not authenticate `/mcp` or
  `/api/*`.

## The URL shape

```
<SERVER_PUBLIC_URL>/c/<integration>/<path><?query>
```

The path tail after the integration name is appended to the resolved base URL, and the
original query string is preserved verbatim.

```bash
TOKEN='eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9…'

# GET https://api.github.com/repos/acme/demo-repo/labels?per_page=100
curl -s "https://workbench.example.com/c/github/repos/acme/demo-repo/labels?per_page=100" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# POST with a JSON body — bytes are forwarded exactly as sent
curl -s -X POST "https://workbench.example.com/c/github/repos/acme/demo-repo/labels" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"needs-triage","color":"ededed"}'
```

`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `HEAD` and `OPTIONS` are routed. The response
comes back with the upstream status and headers, and the body is **streamed** — nothing
is buffered, so large downloads work.

## How the credential is injected

Your `Authorization` header never reaches the provider. The proxy strips it — along with
the usual hop-by-hop headers (`host`, `connection`, `transfer-encoding`, `te`, `trailer`,
`keep-alive`, `proxy-authorization`, `upgrade`, and `content-length`, which is
recomputed) — and then sends the request through the same `ctx.http()` that plugin tools
use. That is where the real credential goes on, according to the integration's declared
auth type:

| Auth type | What is attached |
|---|---|
| `oauth2` | `Authorization: Bearer <access token>`, refreshed first if it expires within 30s |
| `apikey` | The manifest's `headerName` set to the stored key **verbatim** — no `Bearer` prefix — after the `allowedHosts` check |
| `cookie` | A `Cookie` header built from the unexpired cookies scoped to the target host, with redirects disabled |

Every other header you send is forwarded as-is, so `Accept`, `Content-Type`, and
provider-specific headers all work.

Because the credential is attached by the same layer plugin tools use, an expired OAuth
token is refreshed and re-stored transparently on a proxied call, exactly as it would be
on a tool call.

## How the target base is resolved

An integration is proxy-capable only if its manifest declares a `proxy` block. Fifteen
of the sixteen shipped plugins do. `httpbin-cookie` does not.

### Static `baseUrl`

Most integrations pin one base:

```ts
proxy: { baseUrl: "https://api.github.com" }
```

A trailing slash is stripped, then `/<path>` is appended.

### `resolver: "instance-url"`

For integrations that can point at a self-hosted deployment. The base comes from the
per-connection `instanceUrl` stored at connect time, plus the manifest's `pathPrefix`.
GitLab:

```ts
proxy: { resolver: "instance-url", pathPrefix: "/api/v4" }
```

A connection to `https://gitlab.example.com` makes
`/c/gitlab/projects` resolve to `https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects`. If the
connection has no `instanceUrl`, the request fails with 502 and
`No instanceUrl in connection config for gitlab`. See
[Self-hosted instances](self-hosted-instances.md).

### `resolver: "newrelic-region"`

Region-scoped NerdGraph. The per-connection `region` config decides:

| `region` | Base |
|---|---|
| `EU` | `https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql` |
| anything else (including unset) | `https://api.newrelic.com/graphql` |

### The Atlassian `cloud-id` placeholder

Jira and Confluence declare bases containing the literal segment `cloud-id`:

```
https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/cloud-id
https://api.atlassian.com/ex/confluence/cloud-id/wiki
```

That is not a variable you substitute. `ctx.http()` recognises the pattern and swaps in
the real cloud id for your connection, resolved once from Atlassian's
`accessible-resources` endpoint and cached per user and product for the process
lifetime. Send `/c/atlassian-jira/rest/api/3/myself` and the placeholder is handled for
you.

## Failure modes

Returned by the proxy itself, in the order they are checked:

Every one of these is a JSON object with a single `error` key — e.g.
`{"error":"Invalid or expired curl session token"}`. The table gives the `error` string.

| Status | `error` | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 401 | `Authorization: Bearer <curl-session-token> required` | No bearer header |
| 401 | `Invalid or expired curl session token` | Bad signature, wrong audience, or past its 15 minutes |
| 403 | `Integration "x" is not in this curl session` | Valid token, but that integration was not in `integrations` at mint |
| 400 | `Integration "x" does not support curl proxy` | The manifest has no `proxy` block |
| 502 | `Cannot resolve proxy base URL: <reason>` | A dynamic resolver had nothing to work with |
| 502 | `Upstream request failed: <reason>` | The outbound request threw — DNS, TLS, a host the credential layer refused |

Anything else you see is the upstream provider's own response, passed through unchanged.

## Operator notes

The proxy sits behind the same server as `/mcp` and the portal, and it inherits the same
credential store. Two things follow:

- A minted token is a bearer credential for the user's full API access to the named
  integrations, for 15 minutes, with no revocation path. It is worth treating leaked
  curl tokens the way you would treat a leaked provider token — the mitigation is the
  short TTL.
- Proxied requests appear in the HTTP request metrics
  (`workbench_http_requests_total`, labelled by route) and in the Fastify request log,
  but produce **no `audit_log` entries** — the audit trail records tool executions, and
  no tool ran. The mint is not audited either: meta-tool calls do not write audit rows.
  If you need per-request provenance for an integration, a plugin tool is the right
  shape, not the proxy.
