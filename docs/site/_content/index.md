title: What is workbench?
description: A self-hosted MCP server that puts 178 SaaS tools behind 9 meta-tools, with per-user OAuth for every integration.
---

workbench is a self-hosted MCP server that sits between your agent and the SaaS
tools it needs. It ships 16 integrations and 178 tools, holds a separate OAuth
connection per user per provider, and exposes all of it through **9 meta-tools** —
so the agent's tool list stays the same size whether you have loaded one
integration or all of them.

The alternative is running one MCP server per service: sixteen processes, sixteen
credential setups, and every tool from every one of them flattened into the
agent's context on connect.

## The shape of it

  Agent["Agent<br/>(Claude Code, any MCP client)"]

  Meta["9 meta-tools<br/>search · schema · execute"]
  Reg["Plugin registry<br/>16 integrations · 178 tools"]
  Portal["Portal<br/>connect · API keys · revoke"]
  Store[("Token store<br/>AES-256-GCM<br/>SQLite or PostgreSQL")]
  APIs["Third-party APIs<br/>Jira · GitHub · Slack · …"]

  Portal -.OAuth consent.-> APIs
```

The agent never holds a provider credential. It names a tool; the server looks up
that user's stored token, injects it into the outbound request, and returns the
response.

## Why the meta-tool pattern

A conventional MCP server advertises every tool it has in `tools/list`. Connect
five of them and the agent is carrying several hundred tool definitions before it
has done any work — context spent on descriptions it will not use, and a harder
selection problem when it picks one.

workbench advertises only the 9 meta-tools. Everything else is reached by name:

1. `search_tools` finds candidates by keyword.
2. `get_tool_schema` returns the JSON Schema for one tool's arguments.
3. `execute_tools` runs one or many, concurrently, in a single call.

The same discipline applies on the way back. A tool result is serialized into one
text block capped at **60,000 characters**; past that it is truncated with a notice
telling the agent to narrow the request with `limit`, `fields`, or pagination.
Truncated output is deliberately not valid JSON, so a client cannot silently parse
a half-response as complete.
