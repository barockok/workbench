title: Auth modes
description: The four auth types a manifest can declare — oauth2, apikey, cookie, none — with the exact manifest shape, the connect experience, and what ctx.http does for each.
---

`manifest.auth` is a discriminated union on `type`. Pick the one the target
service supports. It determines the whole connection experience and how
`ctx.http()` authenticates.

| `type` | Use when | Credential stored | `ctx.http()` attaches |
|---|---|---|---|
| `oauth2` | The service has an OAuth 2.0 app you can register | Access + refresh token, encrypted | `Authorization: Bearer <token>` |
| `apikey` | The service authenticates with a long-lived key in a header | The secret field, encrypted | `<headerName>: <key>`, verbatim |
| `cookie` | There is no API auth — only a browser login | Captured cookies | A filtered `Cookie` header |
| `none` | No credential at all | Nothing | `Bearer` from `getToken()`, which will throw |

## `oauth2`

The default choice, and what 14 of the 16 shipped plugins use.

```ts
export interface OAuthConfig {
  type: "oauth2";
  authorizationUrl: string;
  tokenUrl: string;
  scopes: string[];
  instance?: { label: string; placeholder?: string; default: string };
}
```

```ts
auth: {
  type: "oauth2",
  authorizationUrl: "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth",
  tokenUrl: "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
  scopes: ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/generative-language.retriever"],
},
```

**Operator setup.** Register an OAuth app with the provider, set the redirect URI
to `${SERVER_PUBLIC_URL}/api/auth/plugin/<name>/callback`, and put the
credentials in env vars named from the plugin name (`google-gemini` →
`GOOGLE_GEMINI_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_GEMINI_CLIENT_SECRET`).

**What the user sees.** Clicking Connect redirects them to the provider's consent
screen and back. From an agent, `connect({ integration })` returns that URL plus
a `connectionId` to pass to `wait_for_connection`.

**Refresh tokens.** `ctx.getToken()` refreshes automatically 30 seconds before
expiry, but only if a `refresh_token` was issued. That usually requires an
explicit scope. Atlassian needs `offline_access` in the scope list. Google needs
`access_type=offline`, which the server adds for you.

Add an `instance` block when the product can be self-hosted. See
[the manifest reference](manifest.md).

## `apikey`

For services authenticated by a long-lived key sent in a header. New Relic is the
shipped example.

```ts
export interface ApiKeyConfig {
  type: "apikey";
  headerName: string;      // value sent verbatim — no "Bearer " added
  fields: ApiKeyField[];   // exactly one field sets secret: true
  allowedHosts?: string[];
}

export interface ApiKeyField {
  key: string;             // form name and getConfig() key
  label: string;           // portal field label
  description?: string;    // helper text under the label
  placeholder?: string;
  secret?: boolean;        // the credential — encrypted, masked input
  options?: string[];      // renders a <select> instead of a text input
  optional?: boolean;      // may be left blank at connect time
}
```

The New Relic manifest's `auth` block, abridged (field descriptions and comments
are shortened here — read `packages/plugins/newrelic/manifest.ts` for the exact text):

```ts
auth: {
  type: "apikey",
  // NerdGraph authenticates with the user API key in the `Api-Key` header.
  headerName: "Api-Key",
  // All tool traffic goes to NerdGraph; pin the key to New Relic's hosts so it
  // can never leak to another destination.
  allowedHosts: ["api.newrelic.com", "api.eu.newrelic.com"],
  fields: [
    {
      key: "apiKey",
      label: "New Relic User API Key",
      description: "The User API key for authenticating requests to New Relic's APIs.",
      placeholder: "Enter New Relic User API Key",
      secret: true,
    },
    {
      key: "region",
      label: "Account Region",
      description: "The region of the New Relic account, either 'US' or 'EU'.",
      placeholder: "US",
      options: ["US", "EU"],
    },
    {
      key: "accountId",
      label: "Default Account ID",
      description: "Optional. The numeric account ID tools use when you don't pass accountId explicitly.",
      placeholder: "1234567",
      optional: true,
    },
  ],
},
```

**How the fields split.** Exactly one field sets `secret: true`. That value is
stored encrypted as the connection's access token and is the *only* thing
`ctx.http()` sends. Every other field is stored as per-connection config and read
back with `ctx.getConfig()[field.key]` — so a handler gets `region` and
`accountId`, but never `apiKey`.

**What the user sees.** A portal modal rendering one input per field: masked for
the secret one, a `<select>` where `options` is set, and required unless
`optional: true`. No redirect, no provider consent screen.

**What `ctx.http()` does.** Sets `headers[headerName] = <secret>` with no
transformation — no `Bearer` prefix is added. If the API wants
`Authorization: Bearer <key>`, either bake the prefix into the value the user
pastes or choose a header where the raw key is correct.

> [!DANGER] `allowedHosts` is optional, and omitting it means no host check at all
> Unlike the cookie branch, `ctx.http()` for `apikey` auth validates the host only
> when `allowedHosts` is non-empty. A plugin that passes a user- or tool-supplied
> URL to `ctx.http()` without it will forward the API key to whatever host it is
> given. Set `allowedHosts`, or guard the host in the handler.

Matching is case-insensitive, strips a leading dot, and accepts an exact host or
any subdomain of a listed host.

## `cookie`

For services with no usable API auth, where the only way in is a browser login.
The server drives a headless Chromium to the login page, the user signs in live,
and the resulting cookies are captured and stored.

```ts
export interface CookieConfig {
  type: "cookie";
  loginUrl: string;
  targetDomain: string;
  cookieDomains?: string[];
}
```

`httpbin-cookie` is the reference plugin, kept deliberately minimal:

```ts
export default {
  name: "httpbin-cookie",
  version: "1.0.0",
  displayName: "HTTPBin (cookie demo)",
  description: "Reference cookie-auth plugin for testing.",
  // No logo on purpose — exercises the portal's default cog fallback.
  categories: ["demo"],
  auth: {
    type: "cookie" as const,
    loginUrl: "https://httpbin.org/cookies/set?session=test123",
    targetDomain: "httpbin.org",
    cookieDomains: [".httpbin.org"],
  },
};
```

Its tools are ordinary — `ctx.http()` handles everything:

```ts
export const getHeaders = {
  name: "httpbin_get_headers",
  description: "Get request headers (useful to verify Cookie header is injected)",
  integration: "httpbin-cookie",
  inputSchema: z.object({}),
  handler: async (ctx: any, _args: any) => {
    const res = await ctx.http("https://httpbin.org/headers");
    return res.json();
  },
};
```

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `loginUrl` | Where Chromium navigates when the user clicks Connect. |
| `targetDomain` | The host tools call. Always part of the allowed set. |
| `cookieDomains` | Additional domains cookies may be captured from and sent to. |

**No env vars needed.** There is no OAuth app to register.

**What the user sees.** A portal login view where they complete the real login
flow in a live browser session, then click Capture. From an agent,
`connect({ integration })` returns the portal login URL and a `connectionId`.

**What `ctx.http()` does.** Checks the URL host against `targetDomain` plus
`cookieDomains` — this check is mandatory and cannot be disabled — filters
cookies by expiry and by domain match to that host, sets one `Cookie` header, and
forces `redirect: "manual"` so the session can never follow a redirect off the
allowed hosts. Your handler sees any 3xx directly.

> [!WARNING] `loginUrl` must be reachable from the server
> The login runs in Chromium on the workbench host, not on the user's machine. If
> the service is only reachable over a VPN, the workbench host needs that VPN.

## `none`

No credential. The integration is treated as always connected, so
`execute_tools` never returns `NOT_CONNECTED` and the portal shows no Connect
action.

```ts
auth: { type: "none" }
```

Only the two internal plugins, `browser` and `jots`, use it — their handlers
reach into server modules rather than an external API, so there is nothing to
authenticate. `ctx.http()` has no branch for `none`: it falls through to the
oauth2 path and calls `getToken()`, which throws `"Not connected"` because no
token is stored. In practice a `none` plugin should not call `ctx.http()` at all.
